Consider a Circle instance with name "Circle2". Is it required to fulfill the where clause of relation myRelationName?

In the beginning of spec. section 7.2.1, it is stated, that it is not required, 
since relation myRelationName2 only needs to hold if its when clauses are fulfilled (which is not the case here). 
This semantics is implemented in mediniQVT.

However in the end of section 7.2.1, it is stated, that "Circle2" must satisfy the where clause, which is not the case here. 
This would result in an interruption of the whole transformation in mediniQVT if we interprete that myRelationName does not hold for "Circle2".

A possible solution would be to introduced a new keyword "optional", with which a where clause can be decorated, 
in order to state that that a where clause must be satisfied or not.
