				models as JSON/XML to be processed e.g. by HTML5/.NET/Autodesk
				Revit... Optionally also generates a REST or SOAP web service for
				CRUD operations on the EMF metamodel (that was a more academic
				exercise..)</td>

				server to the web front end, see the class diagram <a

				leverage the main power of the RaaS generator, to

			<td>OCL transformations</td>
			<td>In the course of work of Distributed Models for
				NEHTA/Australia (now ADHA), OCL expressions had been generated from
				CDA constraints, and those had been put into XPath conditions of
				schematron files and then in an equivalent approach into .NET/Java
				frameworks. The OCL transformations have been refactored and
				EPL-licensed.</td>
			<td>This demo shows that the OCL transformations cannot only be
				used for the CDA metamodel but by their generic nature can also be
				used for UML and even IFC constraints.</td>
			<td>This source can only be accessed with proper credentials, we
				are working on a solution: <a

		<tr>
			<td>IFC</td>
			<td>We created an MOF/EMF model of IFC directly from the formal
				buildingSmart EXPRESS specification using model transformations. The
				IFC model is then used to generate a web-accessible BIM Repository
				for use with Java/UML modelling tools, and Web Services applications
				written in any framework. The IFC Repository is the core technology
				for our BIM portfolio. It has been optimised to allow
				multi-gigabyte-scale IFC models to be parsed with modest computing
				resources. BIM models are stored in cloud-based, or local servers in
				various databases through a smart-caching Object-Relational mapping.
			</td>
			<td>This demo just links the IFC metamodel in order to support
				the transformation of IFC OCL constraints.</td>
